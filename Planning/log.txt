This is just a log for my personal documentation. I want to use this as thoughts and concerns beyond commitments made through the course 
of this project.


Day one note one:
IOS app is up first and I am now asking myself how I want to format it. This is supposed to be based on card games.
So I am going to stick with poker as I have always known. The question is where do I want to go from there.
Solidity is going to help me with just that...but the problem remains.
