This is just a log for my personal documentation. I want to use this as thoughts and concerns beyond commitments made through the course 
of this project.


Day one note one:
IOS app is up first and I am now asking myself how I want to format it. This is supposed to be based on card games.
So I am going to stick with poker as I have always known. The question is where do I want to go from there.
Solidity is going to help me with just that...but the problem remains. 


Day two note one: I have gone ahead and started making a back end portion and yes I have something but that may also include a few errors.

Day two note two: Starting with some of the ios. Don't know why but my button feature was causing issues that I really wasn't sure how to fix but I figured it out.
Note to self if I actually need to go back and code the game portion then I may need to update the server side of things. 
Perhaps a new php file server is required. If that is the case I will need to add player information in order to allow a player profile to be accessable.
